#CHANGE LOG

##Version 0.9

+ DSL Improvements
	+ Simplified Value Syntax - The syntax of inputs & tasks arguments default values and of outputs or results values has changed. We now distinguish between specifying literal values and expressions.
	    + Literal Values - Literals are denoted now as they are in standard YAML. For example, numbers are interpreted as numerical values and strings may be written unquoted, single quoted or double quoted
	    + Expressions - Expressions are preceded by a dollar sign and enclosed in curly brackets (e.g. `expression_1: ${4 + 7}`, `expression_2: ${some_input}`, `expression_3: ${get('input1', 'default_input')}`)
	+ Task Arguments - Task arguments no longer support properties except for an optional default value
	+ Simplified Expressions - We have a new function for simplifying the python expressions (`get("key", "default_value")`)
	+ Use Fully Qualified Name - We now support also referencing an operation or flow by using the fully qualified name (e.g. `do: path.to.operation.op_name`)
	+ New Keyword For Accessing Inputs - `self` replaced the former `fromInputs` keyword for referring to an input parameter as opposed to another variable with the same name in a narrower scope. Can be used in the value of an output, publish or result expression
+ CLI Enhancements
	+  Debug Mode - To print each taskâ€™s published variables to the screen, use the --d flag
	+  Log file - The execution log file is now saved under `cslang/logs/execution.log`
	+  Events Logging - Events logging is now more comprehensive
+ Content Additions - Content has been added in the following areas.
	+ OpenShift
    + Git
    + OpenStack
    + Stackato
    + HP Cloud
    + Chef
    + Google Container Engine (added in beta mode)
	+ Amazon AWS
	+ PowerShell
	+ Base - Math, JSON, Remote file transfer

##Version 0.8

	+ Build Tool - The verifier has been replaced by the build tool, which in addition to checking syntactic validity of a project's files runs the projects associated tests.
		+ Tests - Syntax for writing content tests. 
+ DSL Additions
	+ Async Loops - A task can contain a loop which performs an operation for each value in a list in parallel.
